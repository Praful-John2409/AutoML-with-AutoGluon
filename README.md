# AutoML with AutoGluon - Colab Notebooks and Explanations

Welcome to the **AutoML with AutoGluon** repository! This project is a comprehensive guide to using AutoGluon for automatic machine learning (AutoML). In this repo, you will find explanations and Colab notebooks that demonstrate various AutoGluon models in action.

## Overview

This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks that showcase different features and functionalities of AutoGluon, along with video explanations. Each notebook corresponds to a specific topic within AutoGluon, and I have explained the use of various AutoGluon commands and how they interact with data in the videos.

## Colab series

The explanations of the Colab notebooks are divided into four videos, where I cover the following topics:

## About AutoGluon

AutoGluon is an open-source AutoML framework that simplifies machine learning by automating tasks like model training, hyperparameter optimization, and feature engineering. It allows users to build models for classification, regression, and other tasks with minimal code and configuration.
